I am a Postdoc at the department of mathematics, NYU Shanghai, where I work with Prof. [Mathieu Laurière](https://mlauriere.github.io/). Before joining NYU Shanghai, I obtained the master degree in mathematics from Sorbonne Université (Paris VI) and completed my Ph.D study at INRIA Paris and Université Paris Dauphine (Paris IX), under the supervision of Prof. [Agnès Sulem](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/mathfi/Sulem.html) and Prof. [Hamed Amini](https://aminiha.github.io/). Recently, I am interested in different kinds of mean field games and mean field control problems with complex structures, and trying to understand their depth.
